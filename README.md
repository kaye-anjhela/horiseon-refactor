# Horiseon-Refactor

This repository contains the refactored data needed to update the codebase to follow accessibility standards so that the Horiseon site is optimized for search engines.

The refactored code does this by implementing Semantic HTML elements, providing accessible 'alt' attributes to elements; and, consise, descriptive titles.

The CSS stylesheet has been reworked to become more efficient through the consolidation of CSS selectors and properties by arranging them according to the semantic structure of the HTML file. 

This code should improve accessibility on the Horiseon site and boost SEO optimisation. 

# Challenges 

I faced challenges attempting to place the #hero element inside the <header> container.
I also noticed that on the screenshot provided in the Challenge instructions, there was no footer as compared to the base code provided. Due to the uncertainty of this, I have decided to leave the <footer> content due to accessibility. 
 
# Things I learned

During this Challenge, I learned how to style my cursor in CSS instead of HTML.
I also practiced how to consolidate CSS in a more efficient way by arranging them sequentially according to the semantic HTML structure.
